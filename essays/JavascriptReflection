My interests in software engineering is learning the thinking process to solve problems using code. I want to be able to look at a problem and be able to fix the problem using code I’ve been using. Being able to understand the code better is what interests me to learn more about software engineering. 

I’ve also been relearning an old coding language that I started learning back in high school. That’s exactly how I got started learning code, it was through my high school classes. I was first introduced to Javascript, CSS, and HTML. It’s nice to come back to learn this language again. 

I’ve always wished to have more confidence in programming and hope that I can accomplish that through this course. I want to refine my coding skills more that I can without hesitation start writing code that would work. I also wish to gain the skill to find errors in code faster, or learn how to debug better.
