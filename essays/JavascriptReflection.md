I think Javascript as a language does not seem to be too hard. The basics seems to be doable, however I’ve done Javascript before and that may have helped me with a better understanding. I think Javascript hasn’t been made tedious, it’s very self explanatory and you can do the code at an efficient speed. 

I may have learned this previously but I was shocked to know of the arrow functions. If I were to have gotten used to that format, it would make things a bit faster for me. However, I’ve been used to the simpler way of function notation, it also helps me see what exactly this function is doing. In my eyes, the arrow notation is confusing to me as of right now. I’m also quite new to the E6 stuff. I’ve never learned it and frankly I'm excited to see what’s in store using the new Javascript stuff. 

I don’t think the program languages we have are necessarily bad, Javascript isn’t a bad programming language. It still feels like the beginner friendly choice which is a good thing in its own right. For software engineering where coding shouldn’t be the main focus, I think Javascript fills that role perfectly. 

I like challenging myself with code, it helps me remember stuff and helps keep the gears in check. This style of coding gives me the competitiveness in my nature to do better and faster than what I would normally take. It is definitely stressful, I can imagine the later WOD’s but that’s not a bad thing, it’ll be very helpful in the long run. I just hope it works for me.
