  <p>The use of A.I in learning is to figure out the answer with the help of A.I and find out if that answer given by the A.I is correct. I barely used A.I in experience WODS simply because there was a teacher demonstration to help me better. I did not attend many practice wods but if I was, I woud’ve used A.I to see what answer it gave and figure out if that answer is useable in the in-class WOD. I used A.I for a couple WODS and although it helped me on a few, it was mostly unhelpful because it did not adhere to the rules of the prompt. It wasn’t worth the effort to use A.I for essays because it simply used my opinions and my experiences for the most part. Haven’t used A.I for the final project, haven’t found much reason to use it. Maybe in the coming milestones, I will use it. I have used GPT multiple times to ask it many class discussion questions. It gave some good answers but mostly a bunch of filler answers aswell. I don’t remember asking A.I for a smart question, I don’t think AI is needed for this type of questioning. I’ve used GPT for many coding examples to look at how AI would’ve done it and see if it is more or less efficient that mines. I don’t use AI to explain code, if I were to use AI, it is my duty to explain why this AI’s answer is correct. AI has become pretty good at writing code efficiently and makes it easier for me to just simply use it to save time and focus on more important parts of the WOD or prompt. I haven’t found use for AI in helping me documenting code. I don’t use AI to help me troubleshoot, it is simply what I want to do, though there are times where I would want to use it. I’ve used AI to help me find interesting topics to talk about in other classes.</p>

<p>AI has influenced my learning because my comprehension and problem-solving skills are enhanced by simply taking a look at the answer of AI and finding if that answer is better or worse and more or less efficient than mine. I can then, adjust my code for more efficiency or better code in general. I haven’t found many uses of AI in the real world, only in games or social media platforms. Many are guidance bots for a website or funny games involving AI’s text generation. I’ve encountered the nothingness of AI where it sometimes does come up with a whole lot of nothing as an answer or it simply gives the wrong answer. I don’t see traditional methods being beat by AI-enhanced approaches, sometimes a good foundation is really all that is needed. I can see AI be used for more harder to understand content though. However, it may just be more time efficient to use AI and gets down to more important stuff, therefore learning way more. AI has already been used by many big companies and are finding a space to make use of it.</p>

<p>Overall, AI has significantly enhanced my understanding of software engineering concepts. However, it also poses challenges. Overreliance on AI tools might create a dependency where one may overlook foundational learning or critical thinking. It’s crucial to balance the use of AI-driven assistance with traditional learning methods to maintain a comprehensive understanding.</p>
