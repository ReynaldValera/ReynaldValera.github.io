<h1>Hold customers accountable with our Reusable Takeout app</h1>
<h4>By: Reynald Valera, Jordan Calantoc, Carolina Taylor, Elijah Davis, Micah Schoefield</h4>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Problem: A non-profit organization operating a reusable takeout container program to replace single-use plates/clamshells at fast-moving events are losing 20-30% of containers to folks who want to take them home. This makes the program unsustainable and causes a financial problem for te company.

The Solution: A way to keep customers accountable for returning the company's reusables that is efficient by creating an app or website that tracks the reusable containers and holds each container into a database that checks whether that container has been returned or not. Each container is assigned a qr code pertaining to the user.</p>

<h2>Mockup Page Ideas</h2>
<p>The landing page would have sections of a landing page, user page, container page, and return page. Users in the landing page can sign in and register their card info into the app/website aswell as find information about the program and other contacts. At an event, the user can scan the barcode/qr code contained in the container and is saved to the container page and saved into a database linking their user with the container. The return page will include a return station's location that will check the user's container and safely return it physically and digitally.</p>

<h2>Use Cast Ideas</h2>
<ul>
  <li>New users sign in at landing page, links to website and user, container, and return pages</li>
  <li>Go to user page, set up profile with card info</li>
  <li>Go to container page, obtain a container with a barcode/qr-code, link user with container into database</li>
  <li>Go to return page to find return station location, User scans and returns container</li>
</ul>

<h2>Beyond the basics</h2>
<p> Help features including broken or missing containers. Set up a direct payment portal in the website/app. A way to limit the amount a user can obtain a container before returning a previous container. </p>
